        "description": "Create a unit test for the research_agent, mocking the TavilySearchResults tool to ensure it correctly processes input and generates a structured ToolMessage.",
        "details": "This task involves creating a robust unit test for the `research_agent` using `pytest`. The primary goal is to isolate the agent's logic from the external `TavilySearchResults` tool by mocking its API call.\n\n**Technical Approach:**\n1.  **Frameworks:** Use `pytest` as the test runner, `pytest-asyncio` to handle the asynchronous nature of the agent, and Python's built-in `unittest.mock.patch` or the `pytest-mock` plugin's `mocker` fixture.\n2.  **Mocking Strategy:**\n    *   Identify the exact function or method to mock. This is likely the `.invoke()` or `.ainvoke()` method of the `TavilySearchResults` instance used by the agent.\n    *   The mock should be configured to return a predefined, static JSON string that mimics a real, successful response from the Tavily API. Example: `'[{\"url\": \"https://example.com\", \"content\": \"Mocked search result content.\"}]'`. This ensures the test is deterministic and repeatable.\n3.  **Test Implementation:**\n    *   Create a new test file, e.g., `tests/unit/test_research_agent.py`.\n    *   Define an `async` test function decorated with `@pytest.mark.asyncio`.\n    *   Inside the test, use a `patch` context manager or the `mocker` fixture to replace the Tavily tool's method.\n    *   Construct a sample input for the agent that is known to trigger the research tool.\n    *   Invoke the agent's main execution function (e.g., `research_agent.ainvoke(input)`).\n    *   Capture the final state or message history returned by the agent.\n4.  **Assertions:**\n    *   Assert that the mocked Tavily method was called exactly once (`mock_tool.assert_called_once()`).\n    *   Assert that the agent's final output contains a `langchain_core.messages.ToolMessage`.\n    *   Verify the `content` of the `ToolMessage` matches the predefined mock response exactly.\n    *   Verify that the `tool_call_id` on the `ToolMessage` correctly corresponds to the `tool_call` generated by the model in a preceding step.",

Execute the entire test suite using the `pytest` command from the project's root directory.\n4.  Confirm that the new test case passes successfully in the test report.\n5.  To ensure the assertions are effective, temporarily modify an assertion in the new test to check for an incorrect value (e.g., change the expected content of the `ToolMessage`).\n6.

The test will ensure the agent correctly modifies the application state after receiving data, simulating the handoff from the `research_agent`.\n\n**Technical Approach:**\n1.  **Frameworks:** Utilize `pytest` for the test structure and `pytest-asyncio` to manage the asynchronous execution of the agent.\n2.  **Test Fixture for Input State:** Create a `pytest` fixture to generate a mock state dictionary. This dictionary will simulate the output of the `research_agent`, containing a `messages` list with a `ToolMessage` as the last item. The `ToolMessage` should contain sample data that the chart generator would typically process.\n3.  **Agent Invocation:** The test function will accept the mock state fixture as an argument. It will then invoke the `chart_generator_agent` with this state.\n4.  **Assertions:** After the agent runs, the test must perform the following assertions on the returned state:\n    *   Verify that the `messages` list in the output state has increased in length by exactly one.\n    *   Check that the last message in the list is an instance of `langgraph.schema.HumanMessage`.\n    *   Assert that the `content` of the new `HumanMessage` contains a specific, expected string confirming that the chart was generated (e.g., \"Chart has been generated and saved to disk. Please proceed to the next step.\").\n5.  **Isolation:** The test must not depend on the actual `research_agent` or any real file system operations.

        "details": "This task involves creating a unit test for the conditional router function that directs the flow of the LangGraph application. The test will use `pytest` and its parametrization feature to efficiently test multiple logical paths.\n\n**Technical Approach:**\n1.  **Framework:** Use `pytest` for the test structure.\n2.  **Test Parametrization:** Employ the `@pytest.mark.parametrize` decorator to create two distinct test cases from a single test function. This is the best practice for testing different branches of the same conditional logic.\n    *   **Case 1:** Test the transition from `research_agent` to `chart_generator_agent`.\n    *   **Case 2:** Test the transition from `chart_generator_agent` to the `__end__` state.\n3.  **Mocking Application State:** For each test case, construct a mock `state` dictionary that mimics the application state after a specific agent has run. The `state` is the input to the router function.\n    *   For Case 1, the `messages` list in the mock state should end with a `ToolMessage`. This simulates the output of the `research_agent` after it has successfully used a tool.\n    *   For Case 2, the `messages` list should end with a `HumanMessage` that indicates the chart has been generated. This simulates the output of the `chart_generator_agent`.\n4.  **Assertions:** The test will call the `router` function with the corresponding mock state and assert that the returned string matches the expected next node in the graph.

The key is to test the integration of components, not their isolated logic, while mocking external dependencies for reliability.\n\n**Technical Approach:**\n1.  **Frameworks:** Use `pytest` and `pytest-asyncio` for the test structure and asynchronous execution.
