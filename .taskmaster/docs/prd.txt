# Overview  
A simple LangGraph demo project: "Hello, multi-agent routing". This project demonstrates how to use LangGraph to build a basic graph-based workflow with multiple agents. It is intended for developers and AI enthusiasts interested in multi-agent orchestration and routing using LangGraph.

# Core Features  
- Multi-agent routing: Route messages or tasks between different agents in a graph structure.
- Simple graph construction: Define nodes (agents) and edges (routing logic) easily.
- Minimal working example: Focus on clarity and simplicity for educational purposes.

# User Experience  
- User persona: AI developer or ML engineer exploring agent-based workflows.
- Key flow: User runs the demo, observes how messages are routed between agents, and can modify the graph structure.
- UI/UX: Command-line or notebook-based, with clear output showing agent interactions and routing steps.

# Technical Architecture  
- Components: LangGraph core, agent node definitions, routing logic, simple CLI or notebook interface.
- Data models: Nodes (agents), edges (routes), messages.
- APIs: Use LangGraph's Python API for graph construction and execution.
- Infrastructure: Local Python environment, no external dependencies beyond LangGraph and standard libraries.

# Development Roadmap  
- MVP: Build a minimal graph with two agents and a routing edge. Demonstrate message passing and routing.
- Future: Add more agents, complex routing, and visualization.

# Logical Dependency Chain
- Set up Python environment and install LangGraph.
- Define agent nodes and routing logic.
- Build and run the graph to demonstrate multi-agent routing.
- Extend with more agents or features as needed.

# Risks and Mitigations  
- Risk: LangGraph API changes or lack of documentation. Mitigation: Use latest stable version and refer to official docs.
- Risk: Overcomplicating the demo. Mitigation: Keep the initial version minimal and focused.
